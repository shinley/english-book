Oh my goodness, I don't think we have enough time.</p> <p>Edward: Take it easy. We still have a whole week to prepare.</p> <p>Monica: OK, but we haven't bought a Christmas tree or Christmas gifts for
our family and friends.</p> <p>Edward: How about buying the Christmas tree at the plant nursery
tomorrow? It is very close to our house and we can buy Christmas
decorations and Christmas cards in the nearby department store</p> <p>Monica: It sounds perfect, but the shopping center will only open till
Christmas Eve, so we still need to go Christmas shopping in
advance.</p> <p>Edward: Yeah, the sooner the better. What do you have in mind for the
girls?</p> <p>Monica: I'm thinking a Barbie doll for Lily and a silver bracelet for Jenny.</p> <p>Edward: Great idea!</p></div> <h2 id="unit-2-新年"><a href="#unit-2-新年" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unit 2 新年</h2> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Ben: Five, four, three, two, one.

Family members get
together and have special feast. Traditionally it was a celebration
of the harvest.
UM
liMing: It sounds like the Spring Festival in China. What do you usually eat
at Thanksgiving?</p> <p>Adam: We eat turkey and pumpkin pie. If you're interested, you can come

to me.</p> <p>Eric: I've behaved terribly as your son, and I've taken your love for
granted. Let me make it up to you.</p> <p>Emily: Oh, you have grown up. I'm so proud of you.</p> <p>Eric: Let's go to the new Spanish restaurant tonight. It's my treat.</p> <p>Emily: It's very considerate of you. I appreciate what you did for me today.</p> <p>Eric: I'm sorry I haven't spent much time with you in the past.</p> <p>Emily: That's OK.

What
should I do to prepare for the celebration?</p> <p>Eric: You can buy some chocolate Easter eggs.</p> <p>Emily: Chocolate Easter eggs?</p> <p>Eric: Yes, Easter eggs are usually made of chocolate. Some of them even
have candy inside.</p> <p>Emily: Wow! That sounds delicious. But chocolate and candy are not very healthy.</p> <p>Eric: Well, you can make some Easter eggs using real hard-boiled eggs.</p> <p>Emily: Really? How do I do that?</p> <p>Eric: You boil the eggs and then decorate them with your own designs.</p> <p>Emily: That sounds like fun, but I would prefer to buy some chocolate
Easter eggs from the shopping mall</p> <p>Eric: Actually, that's a better idea because most children have a
sweet tooth. If you take chocolate eggs, they'll be more likely to
participate in an egg hunt</p> <p>Emily:what 's' an egg hunt?</p> <p>Eric: It's a game. Children compete with each other to fin
d hidden Easte eggs. The child who gets the most eggs is rewarded with a prize.</p> <p>Emily: Wow!
