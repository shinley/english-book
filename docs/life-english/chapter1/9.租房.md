# Chapter 9.租房

## Unit 1 租房
::: tip
Daniel: Hi, I'm here to look at the one-bedroom apartment you have for rent.

Manager: OK, right this way. As you can see, it's large and completely furnished

Daniel: What bills are included in the rent?

Manager: You have to pay the electricity bill yourself, but water is paid for.

Daniel: Well, I shouldn't expect an all-inclusive apartment.

Manager: The mailboxes are right down there, and the laundry with
coin-operated washers and dryers is over there.

Daniel: I see. Well, it's nothing spectacular, but it's pretty cheap and in a
decent neighborhood... OK, I'll take it.

Manager: All right, do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease?

Daniel: I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to
summer school. I can extend it if I want to stay, can't I?

Manager: Sure. Just let us know before your lease expires.

::: tip
(Daniel has decided to take the apartment)
Manager: OK, here's the lease. Read it over before you sign it. As you can
see, the deposit is $300

Daniel: Oh, OK. can get the money back when I move out, right?

Manager: Yes, assuming there is no damage to the apartment. Before you
move in, you should make list of marks, scratches, and so forth
that are already there.

Daniel: You won't raise the rent until the lease has expired, right?

Manager: I won't. That is one of the clauses in the lease.

Daniel: OK. If there is to be an increase in the rent, please inform me at
least one month before the lease expires.

Manager: Sure, no problem.

Daniel: Here is the signed lease and the check for the deposit

## Unit 3 搬离租房
::: tip
Manager: Mr. Smith, I need to inspect the apartment before you move out.

Daniel: No problem. Please, come in.

Manager: I'm afraid I'll have to deduct 30% of your security deposit.

Daniel: Why? What's the matter?

Manager: Look over here. There are stains on the living room wall and the
floor is cracked. The lease allows me to withhold your deposit to
pay for cleaning and repairs.

Daniel: Please, don't. I'll clean and make the necessary repairs before
move out.

Manager: OK. You also have unpaid utility bills. Please settle them as well.
Good day!

Daniel: Good day!

## Unit 4 停电

::: tip
Nick: The electricity has been cut off. What's going on?

Sam: I don't know. Let me check to see if the circuit breaker tripped didn't.
Nick: Look at the neighbor's windows. They all still have lights. Well, it can't
be a neighborhood blackout because our unit is the only one that has
no power

Sam: short circuit could be responsible.

Nick: If that's the case, we will have to call the landlord
(Sam calls the landlord and hangs up the phone

Sam: The landlord said our electricity bill is overdue, which resulted in our
electricity being cut off.

## Unit 5 水龙头漏水

::: tip
lvy: Dad, I think there's a problem with the sink.

James: What's the problem?

lvy: I turned off the faucet, but it keeps dripping.

James: Go get the tool box. I'll take look at it.

Ivy: Shouldn't we call the plumber?

James: It is a piece of cake to fix a leaky faucet.

Ivy: You are bragging about your handymar skills again. If you screw it
up, we will have to compensate the landlord or buy a new one.

James: You're right! We'd better give the plumber a call.
